            <h2>Mission: Making Construction Transparent</h2>
            <p>Engineer Oluniyi ADE started Flying Flourish after watching relatives lose millions to dubious contractors, fake land agents and avoidable mistakes. His goal is simple: every Nigerian—at home or abroad—should access the same quality of guidance big developers enjoy, without paying agency-sized fees.</p>

            <h3>Background & Expertise</h3>
            <p>Oluniyi holds a B.Eng in Civil Engineering from Obafemi Awolowo University and an MSc in Construction Project Management from the University of Lagos. He is a registered member of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) and COREN-certified with 14+ years spanning site engineering, quantity surveying, project planning and contract administration.</p>

            <p>He began his career on site with Julius Berger Nigeria, working on the Lekki Deep Sea Port access roads where he learnt international standards for scheduling, cost control and HSE. Moving to a consulting role at Arup Nigeria, he led feasibility studies for rail, bridges and mixed-use towers, mastering value-engineering techniques that reduce cost up to 22% without compromising safety.</p>

            <p>In 2017 he co-founded a boutique firm advising banks on construction-loan monitoring. The role required forensic audits: reviewing bills of quantities, verifying stage certificates and spotting red-flag variations before disbursement. The experience exposed him to the myriad ways inexperienced clients bleed money—exactly the loopholes he now closes for private individuals.</p>

            <h3>Why Diaspora Clients Trust Him</h3>
            <p>Living in the UK for a two-year MSC research fellowship gave Oluniyi first-hand insight into diaspora frustrations: time-zone gaps, unreliable family reps, and difficulty verifying progress. He developed a WhatsApp-first reporting format—daily photos, voice notes, and short drone fly-throughs—so clients wake up to real evidence, not stories.</p>

            <p>He also negotiated fixed-price supply contracts with major merchants (Dangote Cement, Lafarge, African Steel) locking prices for six months, protecting clients from market volatility. The result is the <strong>Premium Package</strong>: end-to-end advisory with weekly progress videos, cost tracking sheet and a dedicated client portal.</p>

            <h3>Community Impact</h3>
            <p>Beyond fee-paying clients, Oluniyi runs a free Saturday Twitter Space “Build Right Nigeria” with over 12 000 listeners monthly, answering questions on land titles, laterite testing and contractor agreements. He has mentored 100+ young engineers on professional ethics, and sponsors STEM clubs in two public secondary schools in Ogun State.</p>

            <h3>Personal Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Every naira accounted for, every variation explained in writing.</li>
                <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> No technical jargon without a plain-English summary.</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Treat every client’s project like it’s his own mother’s house.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> After each project he conducts a lessons-learned review and updates the company playbook.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Media & Speaking</h3>
            <p>Featured on Channels TV “Sunrise Daily” discussing construction fraud prevention, and on TechCabal Podcast on Prop-tech opportunities in West Africa. Guest lecturer at Yaba College of Technology on modern construction management tools (Monday.com, MS Project, BIM 360).</p>

            <h3>Certifications & Training</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>COREN Registered Engineer, R.10811</li>
                <li>Project Management Professional (PMP) – PMI, USA</li>
                <li>ISO 9001:2015 Lead Auditor – Construction Quality</li>
                <li>Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) Level 3 – ISPON</li>
                <li>Autodesk Certified Professional – Revit & Navisworks</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Vision for Flying Flourish</h3>
            <p>By 2030, Engineer Ade wants at least 10 000 Nigerians to complete scam-free homes, while training 1 000 young professionals on ethical construction practices. He is building a digital marketplace that pre-screens vendors, offers transparent unit prices and escrow payments—an “Amazon for building materials and services”.</p>

            <blockquote>
                “Building a house should feel like shopping online: transparent pricing, verified reviews and a money-back guarantee if specs are wrong. That’s the future we’re coding today.”

            </blockquote>

            <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
            <p>Oluniyi is an avid chess player (ELO 1850 on Lichess) and enjoys weekend cycling along the Lekki conservation path. He volunteers with Habitat for Humanity Nigeria, leading quarterly builds for low-income families. He lives in Lagos with his wife and two daughters.</p>
